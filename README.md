# Yet Another Node-Red Dashboard (yad)
A node-red dashboard based on polymer web-components

The main motivation of this dashboard is that users can contribute widgets and their accompanying nodes, just like contrib nodes for node-red itself, but this time for the dashboard!

This is realized via web-components.

The dashboard itself is then built from simple html tags which automatically send and receive messages to/from node-red.

This also allows that widgets are combined with a node-red node which acts as a backend.

## Note
This is a very early proof of concept. Everything can change all the time, do not expect everything to work. Feedback/discussion appreciated.

## Contributions/discussion
If someone thinks this is interesting, I would be pleased to discuss and receive contributions. Even if you think that another route could be more sensible, let me know!

# Current widgets
The core widgets are provided in a separate repository
